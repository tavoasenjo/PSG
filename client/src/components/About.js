        In earlier versions of React Router we provided out-of-the-box support
        for scroll restoration and people have been asking for it ever since.
        Hopefully this document helps you get what you need out of the scroll
        bar and routing!
      </p>
      <p>
        Browsers are starting to handle scroll restoration with
        history.pushState on their own in the same manner they handle it with
        normal browser navigation. It already works in chrome and it’s really
        great. Here’s the Scroll Restoration Spec.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because browsers are starting to handle the “default case” and apps have
        varying scrolling needs (like this website!), we don’t ship with default
        scroll management. This guide should help you implement whatever
        scrolling needs you have.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most of the time all you need is to “scroll to the top” because you have
        a long content page, that when navigated to, stays scrolled down. This
        is straightforward to handle with a component that will scroll the
        window up on every navigation, make sure to wrap it in withRouter to
        give it access to the router’s props:
      </p>

      <p>
        First, ScrollRestoration would scroll the window up on navigation.
        Second, it would use location.key to save the window scroll position and
        the scroll positions of RestoredScroll components to sessionStorage.
        Then, when ScrollRestoration or RestoredScroll components mount, they
        could look up their position from sessionsStorage.
      </p>

      <p>
        What got tricky for me was defining an “opt-out” API for when I didn’t
        want the window scroll to be managed. For example, if you have some tab
        navigation floating inside the content of your page you probably don’t
        want to scroll to the top (the tabs might be scrolled out of view!).
      </p>

      <p>
        When I learned that chrome manages scroll position for us now, and
        realized that different apps are going to have different scrolling
        needs, I kind of lost the belief that we needed to provide
        something–especially when people just want to scroll to the top (which
        you saw is straight-forward to add to your app on your own).
      </p>

      <p>
        Based on this, we no longer feel strongly enough to do the work
        ourselves (like you we have limited time!). But, we’d love to help
        anybody who feels inclined to implement a generic solution. A solid
        solution could even live in the project. Hit us up if you get started on
        it :)

        What got tricky for me was defining an “opt-out” API for when I didn’t
        want the window scroll to be managed. For example, if you have some tab
        navigation floating inside the content of your page you probably don’t
        want to scroll to the top (the tabs might be scrolled out of view!).
      </p>
      <p>
        In earlier versions of React Router we provided out-of-the-box support
        for scroll restoration and people have been asking for it ever since.
        Hopefully this document helps you get what you need out of the scroll
        bar and routing!

        Browsers are starting to handle scroll restoration with
        history.pushState on their own in the same manner they handle it with
        normal browser navigation. It already works in chrome and it’s really
        great. Here’s the Scroll Restoration Spec.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because browsers are starting to handle the “default case” and apps have
        varying scrolling needs (like this website!), we don’t ship with default
        scroll management. This guide should help you implement whatever
        scrolling needs you have.

      <p>
        Most of the time all you need is to “scroll to the top” because you have
        a long content page, that when navigated to, stays scrolled down. This
        is straightforward to handle with a component that will scroll the
        window up on every navigation, make sure to wrap it in withRouter to
        give it access to the router’s props:
      </p>

      <p>
        First, ScrollRestoration would scroll the window up on navigation.
        Second, it would use location.key to save the window scroll position and
        the scroll positions of RestoredScroll components to sessionStorage.
        Then, when ScrollRestoration or RestoredScroll components mount, they
        could look up their position from sessionsStorage.

      <p>
        When I learned that chrome manages scroll position for us now, and
        realized that different apps are going to have different scrolling
        needs, I kind of lost the belief that we needed to provide
        something–especially when people just want to scroll to the top (which
        you saw is straight-forward to add to your app on your own).
      </p>

      <p>
        Based on this, we no longer feel strongly enough to do the work
        ourselves (like you we have limited time!). But, we’d love to help
        anybody who feels inclined to implement a generic solution. A solid
        solution could even live in the project. Hit us up if you get started on
        it :)
